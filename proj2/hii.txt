This article was pretty thought-provoking regarding coronavirus’s role in the US economy, and if it could lead to a bad recession. We already know that airlines are being hit pretty hard, but there is much more potential for the economy to get worse. I think a recession would be very likely if the coronavirus outbreak gets much worse and prevalent like it is in the Level 3 countries right now. If it gets worse, we may all have to self quarantine in our homes and not go out to socialize, eat at restaurants, etc. — basically, consumption would lower significantly, as we cannot be leaving our homes.
