This article was pretty thought-provoking regarding coronavirus’s role in the US economy, and if it could lead to a bad recession. We already know that airlines are being hit pretty hard, but there is much more potential for the economy to get worse. I think a recession would be very likely if the coronavirus outbreak gets much worse and prevalent like it is in the Level 3 countries right now. If it gets worse, we may all have to self quarantine in our homes and not go out to socialize, eat at restaurants, etc. — basically, consumption would lower significantly, as we cannot be leaving our homes. People may be laid off from jobs, since they would be unable to go to work in person, and no one would be willing to pay for this service. The article stated that, as a preemptive measure, the best thing the Fed could do is to cut the interest rate. However, I’m not sure how significantly this could help, since the reasoning behind cutting the interest rate is to encourage people to indulge in more borrowing for consumption. However, this is an activity that would be restricted strongly by coronavirus, as at that point, most citizens would not be eager to leave their homes to do shopping or to work.
